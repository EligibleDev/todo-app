# ToDo Application by Mikail

This is a single page to-do application where people can manage their tasks without creating an account. In this project I've used localstorage to store the user's tasks so that even if the user leaves the website, he'll get his own data after opening the website back.

This project is also mobile responsive on most of the modern devices so, people from all over the world can use this project to manage their task.

The user can add, delete, mark as complete, and make a task inactive. The user can prioritize the tasks by low, medium, and high. The users can also sort the tasks based on the tasks priority and creation time.
Isn't it awesome?
